# gocardless
Golang client for GoCardless API

## Status
This code base is currently at whatever pre-alpha status is called. There is a great deal of development to be done to fully make all the functionality for the API and the interfaces may change. If there is anything in particular that you would like worked on first (I'll just be working on things on a first come first served basis) please leave a note in the comments. 

I am aiming to have this completed and released with a 1.0.0 tag on 1st December 2017
